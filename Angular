We'll be using the Angular CLI for this tutorial. To install and use the command line interface as well as run the Angular application server, you'll need the Node.js JavaScript runtime and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js which you can install from Node.js downloads.

Tip: To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type node --version and npm --version.

To install the Angular CLI, in a terminal or command prompt type:

npm install -g @angular/cli
This may take a few minutes to install. You can now create a new Angular application by typing:

ng new my-app
my-app is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the Angular application in TypeScript and install its dependencies.

Let's quickly run our Angular application by navigating to the new folder and typing ng serve to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

cd my-app
ng serve
You should see "Welcome to app!!" on http://localhost:4200 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with VS Code.

To open your Angular application in VS Code, open another terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the my-app folder and type code .:

cd my-app
code .
